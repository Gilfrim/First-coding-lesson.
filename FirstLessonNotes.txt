C ++ Lesson 1 (getting started with git)

git 

visual studio / not visual studio code.

clear - to clear the command line FOR MACK (useful mac website https://phoenixnap.com/kb/mac-terminal-commands )

cls - to clear the command line FOR WINDOWS

dir - list of files and folders or - ls - for mac

cd - go to a folder

Relative path is when you are moving to a sub folder relative to your relative position. (the shortest path to a right folder from your current position)

or absolute path is a a full path from the root directory to a folder.

cd .. let's you go one level higher. (come back to the next higher folder)

cd\ brings you to the root directory 

git init - initialize the command

git status - to check the status of our files

git add <file name> to start tracking the file. staging

git add . stage all files in the folder.

git commit -m ''" save/commitg a file with some added commentary

First commit:

 git config --global user.name "Your Name"
 git config --global user.email you@example.com

After doing this, you may fix the identity used for this commit with:

    git commit --amend --reset-author

git log - get your commits history

git checkout commit name

You are in 'detached HEAD' state. You can look around, make experimental
changes and commit them, and you can discard any commits you make in this
state without impacting any branches by switching back to a branch.


If you want to create a new branch to retain commits you create, you may
do so (now or later) by using -c with the switch command. Example:


  git switch -c <new-branch-name>


Or undo this operation with:


  git switch -


Turn off this advice by setting config variable advice.detachedHead to false


HEAD is now at a69d0c4 I added two new text documents 2.txt, 3.txt

git checkout master - allows you to checkout of the head state.
